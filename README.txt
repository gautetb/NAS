This folder contains the source code for the bachelor project of group 26 at OsloMet 2019.
The project consisted of creating a membership application for Norsk Arkeologisk Selskap (NAS) for iOS and Android.

The subfolder named Backend contains the code for the ASP.NET Framework application that serves as the backend for our application.
The program can be run locally on Visual Studio on Windows provided all the depenencies and scaffolding does not cause problems. We
are not sure of this, as we have not had the opportunity to test it on more than one PC. The exact same code is up and running as a prototype in Azure app services, 
which can be found at https://gautetester.azurewebsites.net/. Username: admin@nas.no and password: administrator2019 can be used for testing.

The subfolder backend documentation contains API documentation generated with DocFX in visual studio based on XML code remarks above all the classes
and methods. Opening index.html in backend documentation takes you to said site. All the code in the Backend subfolder that does not contain XML 
documentation remarks are automatically generated by Visual Studio and not written by us.

The subfolder Mobileapps contain two separate folder for the react-native apps written for iOS and Android. There is nearly complete code reusability 
between these two apps, but keeping them in separate folders makes it easier to run them for demonstration purposes. Running react-native apps
on a pc/mac requires a lot of setup using npm, emulators etc. We recommend visiting facebooks documentation on how to get started on
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html if the reader has intentions on running the apps without previous experience.
